## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Loading the dataset
df=read.csv("air_quality_health_impact_data.csv")
head(df)
```

```{r}
#displaying summary
summary(df)
```

```{r}
#Checking for appropriate datatype
sapply(df,class)
```
