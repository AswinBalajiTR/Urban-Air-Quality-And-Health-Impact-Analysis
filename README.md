# Urban Air Quality And Health Impact Analysis


### FALL 2024 GWU **__DATS6101__** URBAN AIR QUALITY AND HEALTH IMPACT DATASET AND SMART QUESTIONS

Our research focuses on analyzing the relationship between urban air quality and public health through an exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset captures key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility, alongside health-related metrics including severity scores and health risk scores. By exploring this data, we aim to identify patterns and correlations between air quality and health outcomes.

The following questions are the main subjects which this project focuses on:
   1)	How health risk scores differ between weekdays and weekends?
   2)	Analyzing how key meteorological factors vary across different cities.
   3)	Investigating the key meteorological factors that significantly influence health risk scores?
   4)	How changes in humidity might affect overall health?
   5)	Examining how wind speed and health risk scores vary over days.

These insights could help inform public health strategies, allowing for proactive interventions during periods of poor air quality. Furthermore, the findings may assist urban planners in developing strategies to mitigate air quality risks, contributing to healthier living environments in urban areas.
